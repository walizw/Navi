== Toolchain ==

I want Navi to have its own C compiler, assembler, linker and even own
programming language called Navilang - yeah, i'm incredibly creative.

The Navi toolchain consists of 5 elements:
- Ir
- Navilang
- C
- Linker
- Assembler

==== Ir ====

As navi will have two compilers - and probably a few interpreters as well - I
don't want to write the entirety of them every time, so they will just parse
the language they belong to and generate an intermediate representation, that
ir will take that intermediate representation, generate assembly code, assemble
it, and yeah, that.

==== Navilang ====

Navilang is navi's own programming language, that will be used in - virtually -
anything in the userlang, I hope I write all of it, in navilang - and also write
an interpreter for the shell. Navilang's syntax is based on lisp's.

==== C ====

A C compiler for Navi.

==== Assembler ====

An x86 assembler for the Navi project.

==== Linker ====

A linker for the object files generated by the assembler.
